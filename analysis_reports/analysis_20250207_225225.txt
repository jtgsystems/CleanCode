The code you provided is generally well-structured and follows good practices. It's great that you're using type hints, which improves readability and maintainability. Here are some suggestions to improve the code:

1. Consider using an `.env` file or another method to manage API keys instead of using the `os.getenv` function. This can help avoid accidentally committing sensitive information to version control.

2. The `_analyze_with_prompt` method catches all exceptions with a bare 'except'. To follow best practices, you should catch specific exceptions that you anticipate might occur, like `requests.exceptions.RequestException` for HTTP errors or `ValueError` for issues with the input.

3. Add docstrings to methods describing their purpose and arguments. This can help users and maintainers understand the code better.

4. In `analyze_code`, you can use list comprehension for more concise code:

```python
def analyze_code(self, code: str) -> Dict[str, List[Dict]]:
    return {"analyses": [self._analyze_with_prompt(code, prompt_type) for prompt_type in ["quality", "security"]], "timestamp": os.path.getmtime(__file__)}
```

5. In `generate_report`, consider using the `str.format` function or f-strings for better readability when constructing the report.

6. Consider adding type hints to class-level attributes.

7. When defining the `system_messages` dictionary, you might want to place it outside the function to avoid recreating it every time `_analyze_with_prompt` is called.

8. In `_analyze_with_prompt`, you can use a context manager for the requests.post call to automatically close the connection:

```python
with requests.post(
    self.url,
    headers=self.headers,
    json={
        "model": self.model,
        "messages": [
            {"role": "system", "content": system_messages[prompt_type]},
            {"role": "user", "content": prompt},
        ],
    },
) as response:
    response.raise_for_status()
    return {
        "type": prompt_type,
        "analysis": response.json()["choices"][0]["message"]["content"],
    }
```

With these improvements, your code will follow best practices more closely, making it easier for others to understand and maintain.
